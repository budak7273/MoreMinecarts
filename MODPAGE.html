<p>Adds additional tiered minecarts. All players require the mod in multiplayer.</p>
<p>Likely incompatible with any other mods that change minecart logic. Or, at least, their logic changes probably won't affect these carts.</p>
<h3>New Content</h3>
<p>The new minecarts have the same acceleration as the base game's, which means they will take longer to reach their (higher) max speed, and longer to slow down. Plan your trips and railways accordingly.<br />They have an increased interaction radius (2.0 vs 1.3) so you can get in one from slightly further away.</p>
<p>For reference, the speed of the base-game Minecart is 800.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<p>For bug reports, please ping <code>robb4</code> in the <code>#modding-chat</code> on the Core Keeper discord.</p>
<p>I don't plan to add any other minecarts any time soon. The Solarite one already seems to be near, or at, some vague minecart speed limit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minecarts don't show the white border around them when they're "selected" for interaction</li>
<li>The crafting recipes sometimes appear multiple times. I don't know why this is, but it doesn't seem to break anything. Might be a bug with CoreLib.</li>
</ul>
